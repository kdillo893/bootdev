# [Boot.dev](https://boot.dev) tutorial projects

I was looking for practice projects and eventually stumbled on this. I worked through a few of them, and placed the contents of such projects within this repo.

## [Asteroids](./asteroids)
This is a simple python pygame asteroids game.

## [Hoopla (incomplete)](./hoopla)
This is the start of the RAG course, which I put off for now.

## [WebFlyx (notstarted)](./webflyx)
I forget what this is from.

## [HTTP in Go](httpgo)
Go implementations of HTTP server/client

## [Bookbot](./bookbot)
Simple word scanning thing to search for words within text (eg a book). This is in a separate repo
